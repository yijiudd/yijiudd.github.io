I’m a graduate student in Computer Science and Communication Engineering at Waseda University, affiliated with the [Advanced Multimedia Systems Lab](https://www.ams.giti.waseda.ac.jp/). My research focuses on image recognition (pose estimation) and image generation (human image synthesis). I have hands-on experience fine-tuning generative models such as Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, and I have also worked on building multi-agent AI systems using LLMs. I’m deeply interested in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.
